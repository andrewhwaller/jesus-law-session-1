# How should we relate to Israel's law?

# Two reasons this question is difficult to answer...

# 1. On one hand, we are really good at thinking ***theologically*** about the Ten Commandments.

layout: quote

# John Colquhoun, 1815
“As it is not by the law nor the works of the law, but by means of faith only, applying the righteousness brought near in the gospel, that a man is justified before God;
so in the business of his justification he must set aside all works of the law and depend wholly on the righteousness and grace of the great Redeemer.
While in the business of sanctification the law as a rule is to be connected with the gospel, in that of justification the law as a covenant is always to be separated from it” (_Treatise on the Law and the Gospel_, 140).

# Ephesians 2:5–9 (NRSV)
“But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ....
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God — not the result of works, so that no one may boast.
For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.”

<!-- 
* In the Reformed tradition, we are careful to distinguish between the law and the gospel, i.e., God's command to obey on the one hand and his promise of salvation on the other.
    * When the law is addressed in the Reformed tradition, the _moral law_, i.e., the Ten Commandments, is often what's in view.
* So, we tend to have a really thorough understanding of law and gospel and how those things relate to each other in the context of justification and sanctification.
    * However, this can lead to an anemic undertstanding of the law _beyond_ the Ten Commandments.
    * And, if we're not careful, we can fall into the trap of thinking that OT law = bad, Jesus = good.
* We also tend to divide the law into the moral law, the ceremonial law, and the civil law.
    * These divisions make the law easier to reason about theologically!
    * At the same time, this way of separating out the law would have been foreign to Jesus, Paul, and other Jews in the Second Temple period.
    * There are, of course, hierarchies and priorities in early Jewish legal thought, but observing ritual purity, for example, is still obedience to the law.
        * And, in fact, observing purity is connected to the love command, e.g., removing a source of corpse impurity.

# 2. On the other hand, our Torah literacy is deficient.

<!--
* The classic preacher's joke: "Our Bible reading plans go really well until we get to Leviticus."
* First of all, we're trying to understand the ritual culture of an ancient community.
    * There are all kinds of historical challenges that make this difficult.
    * It's a bit like trying to reconstruct what it's like to drive a car around Austin by reading the Texas transportation code.
        * The transportation code gives us a lot of information about the laws of the road, but there's a lot of experiential detail that you don't get from the code.
        * In the same way, there's a big gap between the laws as recorded in the Torah and the way that those laws shaped everyday life centuries later in the Second Temple period.
            * When it comes to trying to understand how Jesus and his contemporaries understood and practiced the law, there's an information gap that we have to overcome.
* Second, we can become so focused on reading the Law of Moses as a precursor to Jesus that we reduce the law to an elaborate ritual metaphor.
    * That is, we run the risk of, for example, treating purity law or sacrifices as things that don't really have any meaning beyond pointing to Jesus in some way.
    * Reducing the law to this sort of ritual metaphor can cause us to read less carefully!
    * If we're content with reading the law in this metaphorical way, our understanding of the law and its impact on the life of Israel will be deficient.
* These two things can work together to convince us that the law isn't really that important (if it's just a metaphor pointing to Jesus, let's just focus on Jesus) or that it's so complicated that we can't understand it.
    * In my view, much of our engagement with biblical law is marked by an anxiety to protect the _sola gratia_ and _sola fide_ of salvation and avoid any hint of Pelagianism or so-called works-righteousness in our theology.
        * If we treat these questions as settled and proceed from that doctrinal foundation, we may feel more free to engage with the law _qua_ law.
        * Note: this is not to say that we should blindly accept those doctrinal points or that we shouldn't allow further reflection on biblical law to help us revisit and refine those doctrinal perspectives.

# Matthew 5:17–20 (NRSV)

“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.
For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. 
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”

<!-- 
* There are a few clues in this set of verses that suggest we should rethink our understanding of Jesus and the law.
* First, and perhaps most obviously, Jesus doesn't abolish the law.
    * Additionally, "fulfilling" the law isn't an atomistic checking off of boxes.
    * Rather, Jesus came to embody and expand both the restoration of Israel that the prophets spoke of and the obedience that the law demands.
        * The law is part of Christ's restorative work, i.e., the accomplishment of the eschatological "all."
* Second, Jesus tells us not to relax the law.
    * We can talk about how the law relates to us post-Pentecost, but this doesn't sound like antinomianism.
    * Jesus doesn't speak in terms of "Law bad, grace good."
* Third, the Pharisees are called righteous.
    * We will talk more about this!
    * But I don't think Jesus is being sarcastic here.
    * While Jesus has differences with other early Jewish sects about what law-keeping means and looks like, he doesn't completely condemn or write off the Pharisees as a whole.

# When Jesus said, “I have come not to abolish but to fulfill,” what did he mean?


<!--
* This is the question that we'll be primarily trying to answer over the next few weeks!
* Our answer to this question makes a real difference for...
    * our reading of the Gospels,
    * our confession of sin, 
    * and our understanding of the life of discipleship.
